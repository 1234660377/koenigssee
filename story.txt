The first thing I did when getting to the Flughafen(1) in Germany was get a Bratwurst(2).

One bratwurst could not satiate me so my nose dragged me through security to a Baekerei(3) where I filled up on Gebaeck(4).

I looked outside the window and saw a Porsche(5) with a cute hund(6) inside.

I approached the owner of the Porsche and told him about the BMW(7) I have rented during my trip, to welcome me on my trip he took me to the local Ratskeller(8).
