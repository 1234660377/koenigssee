The first thing I did when getting to the Flughafen(1) in Germany was get a Bratwurst(2).

One bratwurst could not satiate me so my nose dragged me through security to a Baekerei(3) where I filled up on Gebaeck(4).

I looked outside the window and saw a Porsche(5) with a cute hund(6) inside.

As the car passed the hund, although cute, stared at me like I was a Doener (7) for the taking. 

Very panicked, I threw a Brot (8) to the hund that I bought from the Baeckerei earlier that day.

Having thrown my brot I was feeling hungry so I went to a Ratskeller(9) and got a Apfelkuchen(10).
