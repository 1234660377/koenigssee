The first thing I did when getting to the Flughafen(1) in Germany was get a Bratwurst(2).

One bratwurst could not satiate me so my nose dragged me through security to a Baekerei(3) where I filled up on Gebaeck(4).

I looked outside the window and saw a Porsche(5) with a cute hund(6) inside.

As the car passed the hund, although cute, stared at me like I was a Doener (7) for the taking.

After watching it go past, I decided to walk down the Hauptstrasse(8) to a Biergarten(9) I had heard about.
